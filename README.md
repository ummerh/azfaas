# Azure Function as a Service Demo
## About
Azure Functions is an event-driven serverless compute platform that can also solve complex orchestration problems. 
Build and debug locally without additional setup, deploy and operate at scale in the cloud, and integrate services using triggers and bindings.
This example uses an HTTP trigger to create a REST API that can detect sentiment in a text made of sentences. Accepts text as a query parameter in a GET request or submit as POST with JSON in the body.
